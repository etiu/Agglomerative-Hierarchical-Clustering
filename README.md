# Agglomerative-Hierarchical-Clustering 


In this notebook, I explored an unsupervised machine learning technique known as Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering. 
I made dendrograms to visualise and determine what the best n_clusters value is.
I also explored other hyperparameters, such as linkage/method, and metric.
A silhouette score of 0.55 was obtained for the model, which is pretty good.
